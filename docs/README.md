# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README serves as the central entry point for OctoAcme's project management knowledge base. Here you'll find high-level process summaries, roles, communication strategies, and links to detailed documentation in this repository.

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme employs an iterative, outcome-driven approach that spans five core lifecycle phases: **Initiation**, **Planning**, **Execution**, **Release**, and **Retrospective**. Every project begins by aligning stakeholders and defining success metrics via lightweight one-pagers. Planning breaks work into shippable increments with explicit identification of risks, dependencies, and owners. Delivery and execution are tracked in a structured rhythm using GitHub Projects, regular standups, and data-informed reporting.

Well-defined roles—including Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, and Stakeholders—ensure clear ownership throughout the process. Communication is maintained through a consistent cadence of weekly PM/PdM syncs, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates. Structured escalation paths and comprehensive risk management practices ensure timely resolution of issues. Quality assurance is embedded into daily execution with automated testing, code review requirements, and acceptance criteria enforced at every stage.

OctoAcme focuses on transparency, continuous improvement, and a culture of psychological safety. Retrospectives after each sprint or milestone capture actionable learnings, and process documentation is continually refined based on team feedback. The organization emphasizes delivering small, testable increments; maintaining clear ownership and accountability; and making data-informed decisions grounded in customer value.
